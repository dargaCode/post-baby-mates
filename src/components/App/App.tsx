        <p>Hello Rachel and Aric!</p>
        <p>Weâ€™d love to offer you our meal prep services to help take a bit of
          stress off your shoulders. These recipes are all staples in our home,
          are generally healthy and packed with veggies, and most importantly,
          they arrive frozen and reheat well.</p>
        <p>You are invited to place an order at [fake restaurant name] for
          4-6 items, at 4-6 servings each (let us know), to be delivered to
          your door a couple weeks after you make your request.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to request ingredient substitutions or removals or
          any other customizations!</p>
        <p>All grains and grain-containing products will be carefully scrutinized
          for folic acid.</p>
